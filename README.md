# Architecture Constructor for C and CPP Files

Welcome to this constructor script to create new project repository

This script is mostly useful for Epitech student, very practical to create a basic repository in C/CPP that are ready to use.

First you will have clone this repository. I personnaly do it in a .script folder, if you want to put it somewhere else don't forget to change the filepath in both scripts.
```bash
~/.script/ $ git clone git@github.com:hgroschaus/archConstructor.git
```

Then make the scripts executables.
```bash
~/.script/ $ chmod +x CConstructor
```
```bash
~/.script/ $ chmod +x CPPConstructor
```

You can now move the scripts in the /bin folder to be able to use the scripts anywhere.

```bash
~/.script/ $ sudo cp CConstructor CPPConstructor /bin/
```

After restarting your terminal window you'll be able to use the constructors !
